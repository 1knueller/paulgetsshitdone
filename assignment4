Write a Program that encrypts a text with a password and can decrypt it again with that same password

The password should be defined by the user. The text should also be defined by the user.

Part2:

The text to ecrypt should come from either a file or user input (booth should be implemented) and should be stored encrypted into a file.
Decrypting encrypted files should be possible by providing a filename and a password.
